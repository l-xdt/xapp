# XApp

A clone of the WhatsApp  chat website.
This is a backup for my hard-disk, just incase they fail. And a place to start from for you.

## FAQ

**Now, my fav, FAQ!**

#### Can I modify this to fit my needs?

Exactly! This is what we made this repository for. This for you to tinker and experiment with.

#### Can I host this? If I can, how?

You can, with my favourite sever (based-off Apache), XAMPP! I have explained it 3,001 times, but here is the rundown.

Apache (contained in XAMPP) uses the IP that redirects you back to your computer (127.0.0.1) to host your little websites.

If you want to go ahead with it, you can get started with hosting by clicking [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzucEZh4_no) and following the tutorial by MainlyWebStuff.

And if you still want a custom domain, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eQGAJVtRCs) to follow the tutorial by Soeng Souy.
